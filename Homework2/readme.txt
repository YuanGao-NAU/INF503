To run the code, you need to do as follows:

1. Compile the code (make sure you have make and g++ installed):
    make main
2. Run the following commands for each question:
    Question 1A:
        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta
    Question 1B:
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta
    Question 1C:
        ./main problem1C /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta
    Question 1D:
        ./main problem1D /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta
    Question 2A:
        ./main problem2A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta
    Question 2B:
        ./main problem2B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta

Note: /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa and /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/test_genome.fasta are the file paths of the read set and genome files in NAU Monsoon,
you need to change it to your own path.
