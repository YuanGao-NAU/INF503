1. Compile the code (make sure you have make and g++ installed):
    make main
2. Run the following commands for each problem:
    Problem 1A:
        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt 5000
    Problem 1B:
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt 5000
        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt 50000
        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt 100000

Note: /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt is the file paths of the SARS_COV2 genome read set file in NAU Monsoon,
