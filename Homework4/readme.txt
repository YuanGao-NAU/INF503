To run the code, you need to do as follows:

1. Compile the code (make sure you have make and g++ installed):
    make main
2. Run the following commands for each problem:
    Problem 1A:
        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000
    Problem 1B:
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 10000
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 100000
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000000
    Problem 2A:
        ./main problem2A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000
    Problem 2B:
        ./main problem2B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000
        ./main problem2B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 10000
        ./main problem2B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 100000
        ./main problem2B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000000
    problem 2C:
        ./main problem2C /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt 1000

Note: /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/SARS_COV2.txt and /home/yg336/inf503/Homework4/readsets.txt are the file paths of the genome read set files in NAU Monsoon,
you need to change it to your own path.
