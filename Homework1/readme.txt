        ./main problem1A /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa
    Question B:
        ./main problem1B /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa
    Question C:
        ./main problem1C /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa
    Question D:
        ./main problem1D /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa
    Question E:
        ./main problem1E /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa

Note: /common/contrib/classroom/inf503/hw_dataset.fa is the file path of the dataset in NAU Monsoon,
